# Music composition with deep reinforcement learning

This project aims to teach a neural model how to compose music using

1. a recurrent variational autoencoder
2. a deep reinforcement learning framework

The code is loosely organized as a series of  Hydrogen notebooks, though the
source can be run as-is with a Python interpreter. Apologies for the mess! This
is very much a rough, work-in-progress concept.
